Hello, I'm Fatima, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the University of Central Florida, specializing in the analysis of information impact on transportation networks at a system-level. My research focuses on exploring the relationship between information dissemination, network mobility, and safety. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, my work encompasses mathematical modeling, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques.

Within my GitHub repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of my academic projects, research, and personal interests. Please note that some projects are currently in progress or undergoing the review process, and as a result, specific details and code may not be publicly available at this time. However, I am more than happy to discuss these projects in further detail and provide updates upon request.

Should you have any inquiries or wish to connect with me, please feel free to reach out via email at fatima.afifah3007@gmail.com. I look forward to engaging in academic discussions and collaborations within the field of transportation network analysis and planning.
